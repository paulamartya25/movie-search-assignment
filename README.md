# [cite_start]Movie Semantic Search Assignment [cite: 64]

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This is my solution for the semantic search assignment[cite: 59]. [cite_start]This project builds a search engine that finds movies based on the semantic meaning of their plots using sentence transformers[cite: 6].

## Setup
1. [cite_start]Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/paulamartya25/movie-search-assignment` [cite: 67]
2. [cite_start]Create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`[cite: 67].
3. [cite_start]Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` [cite: 68]
4. [cite_start]Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook movie_search_solution.ipynb` [cite: 69]

## Testing
[cite_start]To run the unit tests, execute the following command from the project's root directory: [cite: 61]
[cite_start]`python -m unittest tests/test_movie_search.py -v` [cite: 71]

## Usage
[cite_start]You can test the search function inside the notebook with a sample query: [cite: 62]
[cite_start]`search_movies('spy thriller in Paris')` [cite: 73]
