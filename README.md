# Movie Semantic Search Assignment

## Project Overview
This is my solution for the semantic search assignment.This project builds a search engine that finds movies based on the semantic meaning of their plots using sentence transformers.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/paulamartya25/movie-search-assignment`
2. Create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook movie_search_solution.ipynb`

## Testing
To run the unit tests, execute the following command from the project's root directory:
`python -m unittest tests/test_movie_search.py -v`

## Usage
You can test the search function inside the notebook with a sample query:
`search_movies('spy thriller in Paris')`
